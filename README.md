# Sequelize Kanban

## Description

This is a kanban application where I added authentication to existing starter code. It has the functionality for users to log in, have a JWT stored in local storage, that JWT has an expiration time, and will be removed from local storage when the user logs out.

## NOTE

This is currently unfinished as it has not been deployed to render. I will resubmit as soon as possbile.

## Credits

I used code that was corrected/supplied by the edX Xpert Learning Assistant for this assignment.
